Logistic regression is another technique borrowed by machine learning from the field of statistics.

It is the go-to method for binary classification problems (problems with two class values). In this post you will discover the logistic regression algorithm for machine learning.

The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function was developed by statisticians to describe properties of population growth in ecology, rising quickly and maxing out at the carrying capacity of the environment. It’s an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.

$$\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

# Logistic Regression Classification

In the following problem we are a data scientist for a company who is selling a very nice car. An expensive SUV on sale! The company wants to advertise their sale, so they can get rid of all the cars and make a lot of money. They don't want to spend to much on their marketing, so we're asked to make a model to target people who are likely to buy the car after they've seen the ad. We got a data-set of a marketingcampaign for a similar project/car.

We have three explanatory variables, Gender, Age and estimated salary, and we're trying to predict the dependent variable Purchased.



## The dataset Social Network Ads

[Social_Network_Ads](/data/Social_Network_Ads.csv)

Since it is a dataset containing 400 entry's we only show the top and bottem part of the Social Network ads.

Training Set

Test set:

![Logistic Regression (Test Set)](/images/logreg2.png)

We can clearly see that Logistic Regression is a linear classifier. The classifier classifies everything in the red region as: WILL NOT BUY, and everything in the green region as: WILL BUY. So the car company should target people in the green region for their ads.

In the above example, like in most machine learning problems, we've created our model on the training set and are checking it's performance on the test set. We can check it's performance by running: `cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)`. This gives us the confusion matrix with all the mistakes, false positves and false negatives.

The car company should target people in the green area for their marketing campaign. Now let's see if a non linear model makes better predictions!
