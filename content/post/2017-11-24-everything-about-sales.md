# Sales tactics 101. For all sales-tigers
Dedicated to [Kenny Brooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAo-DmzdvK0).

Sales is a very well-known business field. If you don’t sell, you don’t make any money. Therefore the salesperson or sales force is a very important aspect of any business. Being a good salesperson is dependent on a lot of factors. Below is a short summation of the most important aspects. In this section I will try to explain the seven models as briefly as I can. A lot more goes on in the background, but this is a solid basis. Ordered in order of importance.

## AIDA
AIDA and ABC are the most well know sales-models in the entire world, because they are applicable to every sales situation. They aren’t only applicable in sales, but like a lot of other sales-skills in regular daily life as well.

* A – Attention
* I – Interest
* D – Desire
* A – Action

![AIDA - Funnel](/images/aidafunnel.jpg)

The AIDA model portrays the different phases in which a potential customer follows along. The goal of every salesman is to get a potential customer to the next phase. It’s as simple as that.  

The AIDA model is completely congruent with the sales funnel. From everybody you approach, some pay attention and some don’t. From everybody who pays attention some are interested and some are not. From everybody who’s interested some desire your product or service and some don’t. From everybody who desires your product some buy it and some don’t. The result is your sales, it’s a numbers game.

The AIDA model is also congruent to every short sales conversation directly or via phone. To start a sales conversation one must capture ones attention first. If someone is listening to you, you can spark their interest in your product or service. If one is interested in your product or service one can persuade them into desiring to have it as well. If one desires your product or service one can close a sale.

The AIDA model is also applicable for a lot of real life situations. One can imagine a guy trying to pick up a girl in a bar going in similar fashion.

I will elaborate on the different sections below. And some tips on how to get a customer to the next phase.

### Attention
In this phase your number one priority is to get the customers attention. You have to make sure the customer is listening to you. You have to make sure the customer is thinking: ‘Hey, I want to hear what this person has to say.’, and not: ‘****, another salesman. I’ll pretend to listen and make up an excuse.’

If a person is listening and you have their full attention you can try to spark their interest for your product. So proceed to next phase. If a person is not listening and you still proceed to the next phase, you will fail. If you cannot succeed in making a person listen to you, you fail. But that’s ok, we try again.

**How?**
Never talk about just yourself. Find common ground, similarities. Don’t talk about your product/company or anything related to your work. Make a statement about the person, opinion or fact. Ask an open question, be sincerely interested. Don’t talk about, or make statements you think they want to hear, talk about what you want (See: [Rose of Leary](/content/post/everything-about-sales/#rose-of-leary)).

### Interest
Well done, someone is listening to you. In this phase your number one priority is to spark a person’s interest in your product or service. Your goal is to have the customer think about your product or service. This can be broadly interpreted. Thinking or relating about the problem your product solves, already counts. Being sincerely interested in your product counts as well. Not interested? No problem, [Counter arguments](/content/post/everything-about-sales/#counter-arguments) or NEXT.

**How?**
Describe a problem you suspect they have. Example: Think TELLSELL: 'Hey do you have problem X!?', 'Well I have the solution: The super wipe Y!!'
Ask open questions. About the problem, solution, whatever leads them in the right direction and lets them think the right thoughts.

### Desire
Well done, someone is interested in your product. In this phase your number one priority is to let the potential customer desire your product or service. You want them to think: ‘I want this!’

**How?**
Propose your solution, your product or your service to their problem!
Show how your solution already solved a similar or the same problem for others!

### Action
Well done, someone desires your product. Now it time to close. In this part you will explain all the costs and processes affiliated with your product. You explain how it works and close the deal.

**How?**
One closes at the highest emotional peak of the potential customer, when you almost have them begging for it.
The most important thing is: Ask! You have to end with a yes or no question.
Also [Clarity](/content/post/everything-about-sales/#clarity), No lies, no uncertainty, keep it short and understandable.

### Closing note
AIDA and the sales funnel follow the 50% rule of the numbers game. This is, in every phase you lose half on average, anything above this is considered good.

|Approached|Attention|Interest|Desire|Action|Closed|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|32|16|8|4|2|1|

Approaching 32 with a problem, given a solid solution should result in one sale.

## ABC
ABC or Always Be Closing is considered the most widely known sales model in the world. Unfortunately it is outdated, since almost all markets think this method to pushy. A salesman must always keep the old ABC in mind and have a strategy in mind to work towards the close, but use the new definition.

* Attunement
* Buoyancy
* Clarity

### Attunement
Attunement is the capacity to take another’s perspective, to understand their interests, and to see the world from their point of view. In every conversation always try to attune to the situation of the potential customer.

### Buoyancy
Buoyancy is the capacity to stay afloat on what one salesman calls an “ocean of rejection.” Because of the numbers game you will hear a lot of no’s. Don’t feel bad, and keep going. During sales conversations always be buoyant, happy, excited, etc. Don’t be boring, angry or cranky.  

### Clarity
And lastly, be clear! Clarity is the capacity to make sense of murky situations, to curate information rather than merely access it, and to move from solving existing problems to finding hidden ones. Always be as clear as possible about everything during your sales process. **If the client is uncertain or doubting something about the sale, the client won’t buy.**


## Rose of Leary
Rose of Leary is a model for the interaction between two people. It’s applicable in almost every situation in daily life as well. The model describes that a conversation can be divided in two dimensions, the above-below dimension and opposite-together dimension.

![Rose of Leary](/images/roseofleary.png)

For every conversation you can place a dot in this plane for both people. This model follows a rule of opposites for the above-below dimension and the rule of equals for the tog-opp dimension. This means if one person asserts the leading role the other person will be dependent.  If one person asserts the helping role the other one will be co-operative, etc.

In every sales conversation you want to be in the leading or helping role. So make sure you never find yourself on the left side of the rose. Avoid discussion at all cost. Also make sure you are never submissive or insecure, because this will put you on the below part of the rose. Don’t try to please the potential customer, do what you want, and do what you think is best for both parties. Be a boss. If you close while you’re on a different quadrant than the first one, your chances of getting a no are much higher.

Now the biggest trick about this rose is really counterintuitive, because most salesmen always want to please their customers. This is wrong. Pleasing customers will not make them respect you, and in order to sell more quickly you need respect. The ideal situation here is that they respect you, think you’re a boss and they want you to think the same of them. Then they will start to please you, and one way to do this, is to buy!



## Convictions
[Neurolinguistic Programming](https://www.nlp-groningen.com/wat-zijn-overtuigingen-en-oefeningen-nlp/)

Convictions are a super important concept for a salesmen’s motivation. Learning about convictions has immensely helped me during my own personal life as well. One has to be aware that people have convictions about everything. Negative and positive. These convictions are influencing our behavior during daily life. It’s important to recognize negative convictions and break them.

This is a very deep subject in neuro-linguistic programming, but here I will only touch the surface of it. Convictions cause us to think and feel in a certain way. These thoughts and feelings, causes us to act in a certain way. These actions, causes people to react in a certain way. The reactions of those people will support our original conviction even further.

![Convictions](/images/convictions.png)

Convictions are best explained with an example.

### Example
Let’s look at Ted. Ted is a salesman who’s at a networking event organized by the government. He has the following conviction:
“During government network events you only meet weird people where you can’t do business with.”

This conviction causes him to think and feel in a certain way. Ted thinks: ‘Damn I don’t really want to be here.’, ‘Look at all these mongos.’ ‘I definitely don’t want to talk to that lady.’ Ted’s feeling: Awkward, bored and anxious.

These thoughts and feelings will make him act like a disinterested jackass to everybody at the conference.

They’ll react to him weirdly, and will not be comfortable talking to him. They feel something is up.

This supports his initial statement and will negatively influence his thought, feelings and behavior even more. A downward spiral.

### How to deal with it?
Dealing with negative convictions is easy now that you know they exist. You have to recognize when you have conviction about something and ask yourself the question: ‘Is this 100% true, or just my bad view on it?’

Try changing your conviction to something a bit more positive and try to find evidence for it. In our example Ted would be able to change his conviction to: ‘Ok, these network events normally suck, but among all these 150 people they can’t all be bad.


## 7/38/55
Another sales rule from the neuro-linguistic programming field is the 7/38/55 rule. The 7/38/55 rule are percentages, 7+38+55=100. And these percentages stand for what a person will pay attention to when you’re speaking to them. This is correlated and results to: How much percent influence it has on someone saying yes. How much percent influence it has on someone liking you in the first 20 seconds. And how much percent influence it has on someone buying from you. The percentages are:

* 7: Words
* 38: Intonation
* 55: Body language

### Body language (55)
Body Language like in a lot of other different fields, is the most important during sales. Millions of years we’ve evolved and we’ve only looked at body language. We’re not sure when humans started talking, but researchers believe it’s approximately 100.000 years ago. A lot less, than the millions of body language years at least. So always have good posture and portray confidence in your body language. Show no doubt, insecurities or irritation. Be cool, it’s 55% of the sale.

### Intonation (38)
Intonation is the second most important thing during a sales conversation according to the 7/38/55 rule. Intonation consists of: Volume, Speed and Pitch. How you say it is a lot more important than what you say. Boring speaking people might say the interesting stuff, but when your mind is not paying attention it’s all for 'Jan with the korte achternaam'. So talk like a stand-up comedian, not a politician. Make your voice flow in all kinds of directions. Sauce it up. Don’t talk to soft or to slow, don’t be monotone, just be easy to listen to.

### Words (7)
Words is the least important thing during a sales conversation according to the 7/38/55 rule. But beware if you’re body language and intonations are alright, the only way to improve is with words. Just make sure that if you’re saying the right stuff, you’re body and voice are supporting what you’re saying.

## Counter arguments
A salesman never accepts a: no! While this is not entirely true you can always try to convince a potential client, who’s saying no, to think otherwise. Changing someone’s mind can be one of the hardest things to do during a sales conversation and one has to practice this a lot! Luckily there is a model for it which works wonders. Also very well applicable in daily life discussions:

* Understanding
* Questioning
* Bending
* Asking

Let’s explain this along with an example counter argument: ‘I think it’s too expensive.’

### Understanding
Always take their side. Show them you understand their argument and get where this is coming from. Think about the Rose of Leary, make sure you put yourself in the together dimension. This makes them feel heard.

**In our example**: ‘I understand €120 an hour is a lot and we hear this a lot.’

### Questioning
The most important step, but most often forgot! Questioning is used to find the real reason behind their counter argument. Their can be tons of real reasons behind their argument that you don't know about. Bending their original argument can therefore be completely useless. So always win more information first! People tend to directly start challenging the counter argument, finding faults in it. This is wrong and puts you in the opposite dimension. First force yourself to ask three **open** questions.

Open questions are questions that can't be answered with yes or no and are very usefull in gaining more information! Open questions can be recognized by starting your question with a interrogative pronoun which starts with a W or an H: who, whose, what, when, where, which, why, how, etc.

Questioning their argument makes you seem interested (together). You're the one asking the questions and you're not trying to defend yourself (above). Last but not least you're not trying to say stuff you think they want to hear (pleasing).

Sometimes while asking open questions you find out that there is no counter argument at all. Asking questions can result in finding out they just misunderstood or just want to think about it for a week or so. Than there is no problem at all!

**In our example**: 'Why do you think is to expensive?',
'What additions do we have to make in order to make you feel satisfied with what you're paying for?',
'What would you be able to pay for this product?',
'How much do you think is worth?', etc.

### Bending
Now this is where the fun begins. With all the information you won during the questioning you're, in the ideal case, going to use their own argument against them. If you can do that you're golden. Sometimes such bending mechanisms are hard to find. Then use you're second best option and explain why it is the way it is and see if they understand. After that try to find some middle ground.

**In our example**: I get the feeling you want to get $y$ as a solution, but are only will to pay $x$ for it. This will result in a solution that is worse than y and will cost you lots! Therefore I advise you to pay $x++$ for $y$ so you'll avoid unnecessary costs. Or: We chose this hourly fee because $REASON$. Hopefully you'll be able to understand.

### Asking
Always end your bending with a leading question! If you look at them awkwardly expecting them to be alright with it, you're going to be dissapointed. End with a question!!!

**In our example**: 'Understand?', 'So what do you think, want to buy y?', 'Are you alright with this?', etc.

## KISS
And last but not least! Keep it short and simple.
