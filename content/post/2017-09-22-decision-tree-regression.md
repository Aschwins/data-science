Introduction

# Decision Tree Regression

In the following problem we are a data scientist for a company who is again hiring! Man I love new collegues. So this guy walks in and he says he has been a regional manager for quite some time. Pretty bad ass right? Now he's telling us he's making 160k a year at his last company!

What do you think, this guy for real?

Lets data science the shit out of this bitch to see if he's bluffing!

## The dataset Position_Salaries

[Salary Data](/data/Position_Salaries.csv)

| Position          | Level | Salary  |
|-------------------|-------|---------|
| Business Analyst  | 1     | 45000   |
| Junior Consultant | 2     | 50000   |
| Senior Consultant | 3     | 60000   |
| Manager           | 4     | 80000   |
| Country Manager   | 5     | 110000  |
| Region Manager    | 6     | 150000  |
| Partner           | 7     | 200000  |
| Senior Partner    | 8     | 300000  |
| C-level           | 9     | 500000  |
| CEO               | 10    | 1000000 |

## In Python

~~~
# Decision Tree Regression

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Importing the dataset
dataset = pd.read_csv('Position_Salaries.csv')
X = dataset.iloc[:, 1:2].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 2].values

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
"""from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 0)"""

# Feature Scaling
"""from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
sc_X = StandardScaler()
X_train = sc_X.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = sc_X.transform(X_test)
sc_y = StandardScaler()
y_train = sc_y.fit_transform(y_train)"""

# Fitting the Decision Tree Regression to the dataset
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state = 0)
regressor.fit(X, y)

# Predicting a new result
y_pred = regressor.predict(3.5)

# Visualising the Regression results
plt.scatter(X, y, color = 'red')
plt.plot(X, regressor.predict(X), color = 'blue')
plt.title('Truth or Bluff (Regression Model)')
plt.xlabel('Position level')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()

# Visualising the Decision Tree  results (for higher resolution and smoother curve)
X_grid = np.arange(min(X), max(X), 0.1)
X_grid = X_grid.reshape((len(X_grid), 1))
plt.scatter(X, y, color = 'red')
plt.plot(X_grid, regressor.predict(X_grid), color = 'blue')
plt.title('Truth or Bluff (Regression Model)')
plt.xlabel('Position level')
plt.ylabel('Salary')
plt.show()
~~~

Produces the following image.

Smoothing things over produces:

We have learned that the decision tree is a discrete model which doesn't show in the first graph. This is because the resolution for the x axes is to small. Increasing the resolution shows the real shape of the model.

## In R

~~~
# Decision Tree Regression

# Importing the dataset
dataset = read.csv('Position_Salaries.csv')
dataset = dataset[2:3]

# Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set
# # install.packages('caTools')
# library(caTools)
# set.seed(123)
# split = sample.split(dataset$Salary, SplitRatio = 2/3)
# training_set = subset(dataset, split == TRUE)
# test_set = subset(dataset, split == FALSE)

# Feature Scaling
# training_set = scale(training_set)
# test_set = scale(test_set)

# Fitting the Decision Tree Model to the dataset
install.packages('rpart')
library(rpart)
regressor = rpart(formula = Salary ~ .,
                  data = dataset,
                  control = rpart.control(minsplit = 1))

# Predicting a new result
y_pred = predict(regressor, data.frame(Level = 6.5))

# Visualising the Decision Tree Model results (for higher resolution and smoother curve)
# install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
x_grid = seq(min(dataset$Level), max(dataset$Level), 0.01)
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = dataset$Level, y = dataset$Salary),
             colour = 'red') +
  geom_line(aes(x = x_grid, y = predict(regressor, newdata = data.frame(Level = x_grid))),
            colour = 'blue') +
  ggtitle('Truth or Bluff (Regression Model)') +
  xlab('Level') +
  ylab('Salary')

  Produces somewhat prettier pictures

  So we can see that this guy probably is not bluffing.
