Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.[1] Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli≈Ñski and Arun Swami [2] introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule {\displaystyle \{\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \}\Rightarrow \{\mathrm {burger} \}} \{{\mathrm  {onions,potatoes}}\}\Rightarrow \{{\mathrm  {burger}}\} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements. In addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.

# Association Rule Learning

We're a data scientist for a supermarket and we're asked to analyse what product are bought together frequently. This way we are able to place our products wisely so they get bought together more often.

If the supermarket is kind of a dick and knows which products are always bought together, it could also place the products at different sides of the store, so customers will have to walk all the way through the store, resulting to buy more products. If you work at such a store... resign.

Association rule learning has taught us many beautifull things. Like beer and diapers are frequently bought together during the weekends! Why? Because whenever it's weekend and a couple runs out of diapers, who has to get them? That's right, the man of the house, and he brings some? That's right beer!

## The dataset Market_Basket_Optimisation

[Market_Basket_Optimisation](/data/Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv)

Since it is a dataset containing 7501 entry's we only show the top and bottom part of the Market_Basket_Optimisation.

The supermarket asked us to only look at the products which are bought frequently, for example 3 times a day. Since this is a dataset of all the transactions of an entire week we a have minimum support value of 3*7/7500=0.003. The confidence is the percentage that this association is true. So in our case 0.20 gives a lot of results. Setting the confidence to 0.8 for example will give no results.

Looking at the highest lift gives us the best association rules.

## In Python

~~~
# Apriori

# Importing the libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

# Data Preprocessing
dataset = pd.read_csv('Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv', header = None)
transactions = []
for i in range(0, 7501):
    transactions.append([str(dataset.values[i,j]) for j in range(0, 20)])

# Training Apriori on the dataset
from apyori import apriori
rules = apriori(transactions, min_support = 0.003, min_confidence = 0.2, min_lift = 3, min_length = 2)

# Visualising the results
results = list(rules)
~~~

In which we first transform the dataset in the right format, a list. After we use apyori a python function we run locally and can be downloaded here.

[apyori.py](/data/apyori.py)

Gives the same results as in R.

# Eclat

Eclat[9] (alt. ECLAT, stands for Equivalence Class Transformation) is a depth-first search algorithm using set intersection. It is a naturally elegant algorithm suitable for both sequential as well as parallel execution with locality-enhancing properties. It was first introduced by Zaki, Parthasarathy, Li and Ogihara in a series of papers written in 1997.

Eclat only uses support, not lift.
